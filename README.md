OpenSpource is an OpenSource tracker for Open Space Technology events.  It provides a web-based application to allow event facilitators to list topics, presenters, and locations; and for attendees to check the upcoming schedule or propose new topics.

The intended platform is a number of small, cheap, self-contained systems attached to displays around the Open Space venue.  Think Raspberry Pi w/ a cheap LCD monitor or projector.  The app discovers other instances of itself to sync topic & schedule information so that all screens will display up-to-date information.  The application should survive in extremely poorly networked environments, if necessary utilizing portable "seed" nodes carried physically by facilitators to sync information throughout the space even when nodes are out of range of each other via wifi or other networking technology.
